### Module 1
<br>
<span style="color:brown">Introduction to Computer Science</span>
<br>
Computer Science is the study of problems, problem-solving, and the solutions that preceed.
<br>
A computer scientistâ€™s goal is to develop an algorithms, which are stepby-
step list of instructions for solving any instance of the problem that might arise.

### Module 2
<br>
<span style="color:brown; font-size:0.6em;">Introduction to Programming</span>
<br>
Programming is the process of taking an algorithm and encoding it into a notation, a programming
language, so that it can be executed by a computer.
---


#### Loops
<br>
is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.
```python
for i in 2, 4, 6, 8
print (i)
```
---
#### Challenge 1
Can you make a range equivalent to [2, 4, 6, 8]
<br>
```python
numbers = range(1,10)
even = []
for i in numbers:
    
    if i%2 ==0:
        even.append(i)
print (even)
```

---
#### Variable
<br>
variable can be used to manipulate values inside code.
```python
total = 0
for i in 1, 3, 7:
total = total + i
print(total)
```
<br>
---
#### Challenge 2
<br>
Can you make a one line Python statement that uses both sum and range to print the sum of the numbers 1
through 10?
<br>

```python
print sum (range (1,10))
```
<br>
---

####Functions
<br>
are relatively self-contained, relatively independent pieces of code that make up a larger program.
```python
def say_hello_to(name):
	print("Hello " + name)
say_hello_to("Miranda")
say_hello_to("Fred")
```
---
#### Conditional
<br>
A statement that controls the flow of execution depending on some condition.
```python
angle = 5
if angle > 0:
print("Turning clockwise")
elif angle < 0:
print("Turning anticlockwise")
else:
print("Not turning at all")
```

---
#### Module 3
<span style="color:brown; font-size:0.6em;">Object Oriented Programming (OOP)</span>
**class**

```python
class pet()
	number_of_legs = 0
	
	def run(self):
		print "flash"
		
	def count_legs(self):
		print "I have %s Legs " % self.number_of_legs
dog = pet()
dog.run()
dog.number_of_legs = 4
fish = pet()
fish.number_of_legs = 0
fish.count_legs()
```

---
### Module 4
<br>
<span style="color:brown; font-size:0.6em;">Data Structures and Algorithms</span>
<br>
is an arrangement of data in a computer's memory or even disk storage.

---
### Arrays & List
<br>
The main difference between arrays and lists. While python lists can contain values corresponding to different data types, arrays in python can only contain values corresponding to same data type.
<br>

---
### Stack
<br>
Stack is a last-in-first-out strategy data structure; this means that the element stored in last will be removed first.
